System Overview
===============

The High Performance Storage System (HPSS) provides tape storage for large
amounts of data created on OLCF systems. The HPSS can be accessed from any OLCF
system through the ``hsi`` utility. More information about using HPSS can be found
in the :ref:`data-hpss` section of the :ref:`data-storage-and-transfers` page.
